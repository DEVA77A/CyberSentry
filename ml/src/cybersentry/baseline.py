"""Incumbent: the M1 Sigma-style rule pack, re-expressed as a weighted scorer over the
same behavioural counters the model reads - which makes the comparison airtight. Rules
stay in production beside the model (they are explainable and ATT&CK-tagged); the model
has to earn the queue by catching what the rules miss at the same analyst budget."""
